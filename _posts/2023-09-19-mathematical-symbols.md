On the 20th of April 2023, I submitted my year-end work about Categorizing and Describing the visual language of math. It is heavily based on the works of Florian Cajori and written in Czech. Just like my paper on [Open Source](/open-source-thesis/), I licensed it under the <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>. Feel free to download the [PDF](/static/Matematické%20značky.pdf).

I acknowledge that this is the first 2023 post and most likely the last. There's a bunch of stuff happening all over, beginning at Gitpod and ending at school with my last year there. It's tough stuff, but that makes it fun.
