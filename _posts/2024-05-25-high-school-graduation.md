On May 21st, I graduated high school and as per some of my friends and relatives finally became an "adult". I could imagine doing something more productive in two and a half weeks than just learning geography trivia, but I can finally rest easy knowing that I will most likely never have to do that ever again.

For those wondering, for Czech literature I drew a question about Boule de Suif by Guy de Maupassant and for geography I talked about geographical and socioeconomical features of the region of North Africa and Southwestern Asia. The topic for English is probably not even worth mentioning, considering it was among the most straight forward ones (it was food).

I did not do much on the coding front this month, but there are a few highlights I can share:

- The project I described in my graduation paper from ICT, seminare, was open-sourced. You can read more about it in its dedicated [blog post](/seminare).
- open-vsx.org's [publish-extensions repo](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/) got proper target platform support for building different flavors of extensions for different architectures and OSes.
- The [Swift extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/sswg/swift-lang) was published to open-vsx.org!

Now, to address the elephant in the room: what will I do after high school? To be honest, not much will change. I am staying at Gitpod, building the future of developmentâ„¢, where I'll get to spend considerably more time than I used to. It's an exciting time be alive :). 

With that, I've said all I wanted to. See you later folks!
