# Get started building your personal website
[![Codeship Status for filiptronicek/filiptronicek.github.io](https://app.codeship.com/projects/4c810410-9f75-0138-4653-6678402409b7/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/401750)
### Showcase your software development skills

This repository gives you the code you'll need to kickstart a personal website that showcases your work as a software developer. And when you manage the code in a GitHub repository, it will automatically render a webpage with the owner's profile information, including a photo, bio, and repositories.

Your personal website is waiting to be personalized, though. It includes space to highlight your specific areas of interest in software development, like languages or industries. And it's standing by to publish your next great blog post.

It's all possible using the combination of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) (for building your website), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (for hosting your website), and [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (for automatically populating your website with content).

## Installation

### Fork the `github/personal-website` repo

You'll be making your own copy of the "personal website starter" repository so you have your own project to customize. A "fork" is a copy of a repository. So select "Fork" atop [the `github/personal-website` repository](https://github.com/github/personal-website).

Once you've found a home for your forked repository, it's yours. You're the owner, so you're ready to publish, if you wish.

### Install in your local development environment

If you want to manage your website in a local web development environment, you'll be using [Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once you've found a home for your forked repository, **[clone it](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)**.

#### Install Jekyll

Jekyll is a [Ruby Gem](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems) that can be installed on most systems.

1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Install Jekyll and [bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#bundler) [gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems)
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```
3. Change into your new directory
```
cd personal-website
```
4. Install missing gems
```
bundle install
```
5. Build the site and make it available on a local server
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
### Publish

When you host your personal website's code on GitHub, you get the support of free hosting through GitHub Pages.

**The fastest approach** is to rename your repository `username.github.io`, where `username` is your GitHub username (or organization name). Then, the next time you push any changes to your repository's `master` branch, they'll be accessible on the web at your `username.github.io` address.

**If you want to use a custom domain**, you'll want to add it to your repository's "Custom domain" settings on github.com. And then register and/or [configure your domain with a DNS provider](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/).
